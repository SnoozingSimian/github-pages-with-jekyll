# Setting up Julia on Gradient Notebooks

    This will be a quick tutorial on how to set up Julia on Gradient Notebooks. There are two main reasons why you might want to know how to do this.
    
    1. The popularity of Julia in the Machine Learning (ML) is on the rise, this might be the ideal time to start learning Julia to stay ahead of the curve of others.
    2. Paperspace provides extremely attractive pricings when compared to other notebook servers like Google Colabs and allows you more persistent storage for a much smaller fee (In case you opt for the the paid tier of the Gradient Notebooks). This means you can work on larger projects and handle more data for a lower cost, which is always good.
